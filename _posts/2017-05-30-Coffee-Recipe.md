## Motivation

I enjoy coffee, but I find most coffee to be too bitter. This is a symptom of over-extraction.
Here is my recipe for minimally bitter coffee.

## Materials needed

- Pot
- Scale

# Grind

I have my grider set to the most coarse setting.

# Preheat

Warm up all the glassware with some nearly boiling water.

# Weights

Weigh out the grounds. I aim for 10:1 water:coffee by mass.

# First Pour

The goal here is to clog the filter. About 100g is usually sufficient.

# Stir

Give it a swirl to ensure everything is evenly distributed.

# Final Pour

Pour the rest of the water.

# Enjoy

Coffee should taste good, not bitter.
