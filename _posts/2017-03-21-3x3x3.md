Here is my approach to solving a standard 3x3x3 Rubic's Cube. There's nothing new here. It's just how I learned about 12 years ago.

<!--more-->

I try to use as few algorithms as possible, but it is handy to be familiar with the
[notation](https://ruwix.com/the-rubiks-cube/notation/).

images were created using this [site](https://rubiks-cube-solver.com/).

I add the word loop() when there is a step or combination that can be repeated indefinitely.

## Fundamentals
- the cube is composed of 26 3-dimensional pieces. 8 corners, 12 Edges, 6 Centers. Stop thinking about each 2D colored square and start thinking in 3D.
- center pieces do not move, they define color of each side.

## Phase 1 - 1st corner
 	- place the 1st corner and find the 1st 3 edges

*starting with the red/white/blue corner*

place 1st, 2nd, and 3rd edges 
by aligning 1 color ( there are three sides that can move freely without moving the 1st corner. )
then move the 1st corner out of the way temporarily.
for example, F loop(U) F' will place the UR edge.

*the Left, Back, and Down sides can still move freely*

    
## Phase 2 - 2nd corner
 	- place 2nd corner

 	- place 2 more edges

 	  - target 1 side
    - F' U2 F
    - L U L'

## Phase 3 - 2nd layer

*rotate the cube so you can hold it by the solved portion and move the remaining 2 sides easily*


#### Edge Parity
- target 2 unpaired edges (these always occur in pairs)
  - U' R' U

####   Place next corner
- loop(R U)

####   place 2 more edges
- target 1 side
  - U R loop(U) R' U'
  - U2 R' loop(U) R U2

####   Place last corner of 2nd layer
- orient corner
  - loop(U R2 U' R)
- place
  - R' U' R U

####   Place last edge of 2nd layer
- U R U R loop(U) R' U' R' U'

## Phase 4 - Last Layer

####   permute 2 corners
- target 2 adjacent corners
  - left version:  R  U' L' \| U  \| R' U' L
  - right version: L' U  R  \| U' \| L  U  R'

####   Orient remaining corners
- target 1 corner 1st
  - R U R' U R U2 R'

####   permute last 3 edges
- clockwise version: B2 U  L' R \| B2 \| L R' U  B2
- counter clockwise: B2 U' L' R \| B2 \| L R' U' B2
