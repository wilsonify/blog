After watching this [presentation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vq2nnJ4g6N0), where Martin GÃ¶rner shows the use of 
recurrent neural networks to create a new Shakespear play, I was feeling inspired.
So, I pointed his code a bunch of song lyrics.

# Getting the lyrics
First, I used the [Genius API](https://docs.genius.com/) to find as many Beatles songs as possible.

# Tensorflow
Then I installed google's Tensorflow

# Training
I then got to work training my neural network to predict Beatles song lyrics.

# Result
I think it's beautiful.
