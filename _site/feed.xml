Solution: Use an Arduino to control the temperature of pan.

I started by purchasing a k-type thermocouple from amazon (about $5). I also needed some female connections to connect to my circuit.

The thermo couple is composed of two wires, each a different alloy of chrome.

Any temperature difference between the ends will create a current in the wire. I should be able to measure the current with my arduino and hopefully use that signal to control the temperature of my pan.

My plan is to control the temperature just below the smoke point of what every oil is being used.
