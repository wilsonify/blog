Solution: Use an Arduino to control the temperature of pan.

I started by purchasing a k-type thermocouple from amazon (about $5). I also needed some female connections to connect to my circuit.

The thermo couple is composed of two wires, each a different alloy of chrome.

Any temperature difference between the ends will create a current in the wire. I should be able to measure the current with my arduino and hopefully use that signal to control the temperature of my pan.

My plan is to control the temperature just below the smoke point of what every oil is being used.

I try to use as few algorithms as possible, but it is handy to be familiar with the
[notation](&quot;https://ruwix.com/the-rubiks-cube/notation/&quot;).

I add the word loop() when there is a step or combination that can be repeated indefinitely.

# Fundamentals
- the cube is composed of 26 3-dimensional pieces. 8 corners, 12 Edges, 6 Centers. Stop thinking about each 2D colored square and start thinking in 3D.
- center pieces do not move, they define color of each side.

# Phase 1 - 1st corner
 	- place the 1st corner
 	- place 1st 2 edges
 	- place the 3rd edge
 	  - target 1 side
    - L U L'
# Phase 2 - 2nd corner
 	- place 2nd corner
 	- place 2 more edges
 	  - target 1 side
    - F' U2 F
    - L U L'

# Phase 3 - 2nd layer

## Edge Parity
- target 2 unpaired edges (these always occur in pairs)
  - U' R' U

##   Place next corner
- loop(R U)

##   place 2 more edges
- target 1 side
  - U R loop(U) R' U'
  - U2 R' loop(U) R U2

##   Place last corner of 2nd layer
- orient corner
  - loop(U R2 U' R)
- place
  - R' U' R U

##   Place last edge of 2nd layer
- U R U R loop(U) R' U' R' U'

# Phase 4 - Last Layer

##   permute 2 corners
- target 2 adjacent corners
  - left version:  R  U' L' | U  | R' U' L
  - right version: L' U  R  | U' | L  U  R'

##   Orient remaining corners
- target 1 corner 1st
  - R U R' U R U2 R'

##   permute last 3 edges
- clockwise version: B2 U  L' R | B2 | L R' U  B2
- counter clockwise: B2 U' L' R | B2 | L R' U' B2</content><author><name></name></author><category term="puzzles" /><summary type="html">Here is my approach to solving a standard 3x3x3 Rubic’s Cube.
