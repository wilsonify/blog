## Professional Website for Thomas Wilson
This is my personal/professional website.
I used Jekyll with a custom theme.


## To Do
Jekyll becomes read/write limited every time an include is used causing build time to grow very quickly.
As my post counts goes up, I intend to remove as many \_includes as possible by merging \_layouts using conditional liquid tags.

### Theme
