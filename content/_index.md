This site was created to be an example of my work as well as showcase my interests and projects. 

My name is Thomas Wilson. 
I'm a Data Scientist living in Lewisburg, PA.

I worked in the semiconductor industry for 6 years, where I realized the importance of data for making statistically sound business decisions.

Since then,  
I am passionate about data analysis and visualization. I'm also very knowledgeable about engineering, chemistry, and computers.
