# Professional Experience
### Samsung Austin Semiconductor, Austin, Texas 
#### Plasma Etch Process Engineer III (2011 – 2016)
Orchestrated continuous improvement in the quality, cost, and production of fluorine based etching of  low-k silicon-oxides used in the fabrication of thin copper wires while addressing international clients’ new product integration needs. Managed complex engineering projects, resolving problems through root cause identification, design of experiments, and big data analysis. Developed change point management plans for process changes. 
Key Achievements:
- Awarded corporate awards during consecutive quarters between Q3-2015 and Q1-2016 which recognized 2% improved yield valued at $2,000,000 annually, 73% defect reduction, and world-class new product integration respectively.
- Spearheaded $100,000 savings per device, using breakthrough ideas for eliminating the use of sample wafers during new product integration.
- Reduced by 90% the man-days of new product setup time.
- Saved $4,800,000/ year by reducing process variation 80% (1 Ppk improved to 1.8 Ppk) thus eliminating scrap.
- Secured future company business as a member of the New Product Team, establishing hundreds of new products for new customers.

### Munson Excavating and Septic, Utica, Illinois
#### Technician (2010 – 2010)
Operated laser level to ensure accurate finish grade for new septic system installation and provided the corporate office with computer consultation support. 
Key Achievements:
- Managed routine septic maintenance to protect system functionality and meet customer expectations. 
- Improved computer uptime by providing computer troubleshooting, replacing the router, and completing document restoration process.

### Carus Chemical, La Salle, Illinois
#### Process Development Intern (2008 –2009)
Carus Chemical is the largest and only manufacturer of potassium permanganate in the western hemisphere. Conducted experiments for the scale-up of a new oxidation process reacting potassium hydroxide with manganese dioxide in the presence of gaseous oxygen in addition to other miscellaneous process development activities.
Key Achievements:
- Developed process flow diagrams, as well as piping and instrumentation diagrams.
- Innovated the process design package for vacuum pump replacement used in crystallization of mother liquor into final product.
- Produced KMnO2 at a cheaper and safer temperature, in 96% less time; this experimentation and methodology offered key insights which were used in the design of a pilot plant scale reactor.
